Contact App
	1) Create "contacts" table if not exists in DB. (Tip: preparedStatement.execute())
	   It should have id(int), first_name(varchar not null), last_name(varchar not null),email(varchar) columns
	2) Prompt user input for one of the actions: search, insert, update, delete or exit.
	3) Perform partial search for a given name (Tip: sql like). Search should work case insensitive.
           (Tip: preparedStatement.executeQuery())
	4) Insert by entering first_name, last_name, email fields (Tip: preparedStatement.executeUpdate())
	5) Delete by id field
	6) Update by id field and getting new first_name, last_name, email fields from console input
	7) Use PreparedStatement for insert, select, update and delete operations.
